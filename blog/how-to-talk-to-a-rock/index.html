<div class="post-body">
<div><p>Have you ever talked to a rock?  Most rocks are actually very smart, much smarter than your teacher.  If you can talk with a rock, you&#8217;ll learn more in one hour than you&#8217;ll ever learn in school.   
</p><p>Some people think the art of &#8220;rock-talking&#8221; is impossible.  They&#8217;re wrong.  If you know the secrets that I know, it&#8217;s difficult, but it&#8217;s not impossible. 
</p><p>Of course, if you tell everyone you&#8217;re going to go talk to a rock, some folks will say things like, &#8220;But rocks don&#8217;t talk!&#8221; or &#8220;Are you feeling okay?&#8221; or &#8220;Rocks are only good for eating!&#8221; Don&#8217;t worry.  They&#8217;re wrong.  Rocks <em>can</em> talk. 
</p><p>But how can you get one to talk to you?   
</p><p>First, here&#8217;s some things <em>not</em> to do.  <em>Don&#8217;t</em> walk up to a strange rock and say things like, &#8220;Hey, rock,&#8221; or &#8220;Would you please help me study fractions, rock?&#8221;  The rock will frown and not say a word.  It may even bite your toe.  Rock frowns are hard to notice unless you&#8217;re an expert like myself, but rock bites are obvious to anyone!  
</p><p>It&#8217;s not that rocks aren&#8217;t friendly.  Just imagine how you would feel if a huge monster walked up to you and said, &#8220;Hey, human.  Can you teach me to breathe?&#8221;  Do you talk to strange creatures that ask dumb questions?  Rocks are the same way.  
</p><p>Here&#8217;s another tip.  <em>Never throw or kick</em> a rock.  Imagine.  You&#8217;re sitting quietly, not bothering anyone.  Then, all at once, there&#8217;s an awful-smelling humongous monster all around you.  <em>Whoosh!</em>  You whiz through the air and plop down in some crazy place that&#8217;s miles from your home.  You&#8217;re lost, scared, and angry.  Then the monster stomps up and yells, &#8220;Hey, human.  Teach me how to scratch my head!&#8221;   
</p><p>Would you help that monster?  Me neither.   
</p><p>Okay.  Now that you know what <em>not</em> to do, it&#8217;s time for the real secrets.  How <em>do</em> you get a rock to talk?   
</p><p>The first and most basic secret of rock-talking is quite simple.  Never talk to any rock until another rock introduces you. 
</p><p>Isn&#8217;t that easy? 
</p><p>Almost no one ever gets <em>introduced</em> to a rock.  That&#8217;s why rocks are so quiet around us.  They&#8217;re just shy.   
</p><p>Of course, maybe you&#8217;ve noticed a small problem.  &#8220;Wait,&#8221; you say, &#8220;If I can&#8217;t talk to a rock until I&#8217;m already friends with another rock, how do I ever talk to my <em>first</em> rock?&#8221;  
</p><p>Well, ah, if you noticed that, you&#8217;re ahead of the game.  It took me three years and quite a few long, boring days to realize this problem.  Congratulations.  You&#8217;re a natural. 
</p><p>The hard truth is that you&#8217;ll need to find a <em>different</em> way to meet your first rock.  Once you&#8217;ve made one rock friend, you&#8217;ll be a real member of rock society.  But to make that happen, you&#8217;ll have to get creative.  Fortunately, I have another secret. 
</p><p>Think about it.  How do you make friends with people?  Of course.  You do things together.   
</p><p>So here&#8217;s the second secret.  To make friends with your first rock, politely invite it to join you in an activity that you both enjoy. 
</p><p>This isn&#8217;t as easy as it sounds.  Imagine a rock trying to do some of your favorite activities&#8211;playing checkers, hiking, eating bananas.  Rocks may be smart, but there are many activities that they can&#8217;t do.   
</p><p>It&#8217;s rude to ask a rock to join you in something it can&#8217;t do.  The rock may get offended and refuse to say a word.  After a few thousand years, it&#8217;ll forgive you and might want to talk.  Unfortunately, by then you may be dead or you and your family may have moved away.   
</p><p>So what do rocks like to do? 
</p><p>Basically, what rocks like best is to sit where they are.  They&#8217;re very good at this.  They have contests that last millions of years.  (This is another reason not to move a rock.)   
</p><p>So here&#8217;s the third, biggest secret.  Crawl slowly up to a rock and whisper, &#8220;May I have the pleasure of sitting with you?&#8221;  Nine rocks out of ten will be delighted.  When rocks are happiest, they can&#8217;t speak.  If the rock doesn&#8217;t talk right away, that&#8217;s a good sign.  
</p><p>The rare rock who wants to be left alone will probably be angry.  Don&#8217;t worry, it won&#8217;t yell.  When rocks are angriest, they can&#8217;t speak.  If the rock stays quiet, just move on and try another rock. 
</p><p>Did you notice that a silent rock may be either very happy or very angry?  You&#8217;ve noticed another reason why so few people take the time to talk to rocks.  How can you tell whether a quiet rock is happy or sad? 
</p><p>When I figure that out, I&#8217;ll write another article. 
</p><p>In the meantime, if a rock is quiet, hopefully it&#8217;s happy and it wants to sit with you.  So sit.  Don&#8217;t move.  Rocks don&#8217;t move much, and they distrust anything that does.  Be still. 
</p><p>You&#8217;ll probably have to wait awhile before the rock talks.  Remember, rocks live for thousands of years.  They don&#8217;t mind waiting.  Some books say that the average rock won&#8217;t talk for at least six hundred years.  I think that&#8217;s a little long.  If you&#8217;re very still, your average rock will probably crack a joke after only three or four hundred years.  Be patient.   
</p><p>It can be tough.  I once sat next to a rock for five whole years.  Then a flood washed us apart.  That was frustrating.  But I haven&#8217;t given up.  As soon as I finish writing this article, I&#8217;m going to walk right out and make friends with a new rock.  Why don&#8217;t you do the same?  You&#8217;ll be glad you did! 
</p><p>Oh, and here&#8217;s one last tip.  I forgot to do this last time.  Bring some food. <div class="postfooter">   </div></p></div>
